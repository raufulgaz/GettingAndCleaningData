Codebook for dataset "UCI-HAR-tidydata.txt"

All data was obtained from this study:

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

Dataset Information:

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Activity label and identifier.
- Acceleration from the accelerometer and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 

The 180 observations are averaged values derived from a larger database of 10299 observations.

Data Set Information:

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are mean (Mean value) and std(Standard deviation)

Variable names:

 [1] "datasource":	"train" or "test"
 [2] "subjectid":	groups (1 : 30)                                                        
 [3] "activity":	WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING                                                              
 [4] "activityid":	six actitivities (1 : 6)                                                       
 [5] ...
     measure x,y,z mean and x,y,z standard deviation
